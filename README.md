- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @skcodes-dotcom
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3.
I haven't used GitHub since I graduated in 2018. I'm teaching myself how to code all over again... so far, I'm doing okay... I've got a long way to go, but my aim is to secure a Junior Front End Developer role this year. 
Follow me as I get better at this... I'll be dropping some projects soon. (wish me luckðŸ““ðŸ˜…)
